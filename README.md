# MATLAB Codes for Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions developed for polyhedron plotting and calculation, as part of a Bachelor thesis project. The codebase is designed to support geometric visualization and computational tasks related to polyhedra, including:

- Plotting various types of polyhedra in 2D and 3D
- Calculating properties such as volume, surface area, vertices, edges, and faces
- Customizable visualization features for research and presentation purposes

## Features

- **Polyhedron Generation**: Create and visualize common and custom polyhedra.
- **Geometric Calculations**: Compute essential properties and characteristics of polyhedra.
- **Interactive Plots**: Manipulate and explore polyhedral shapes through graphical MATLAB interfaces.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2002Quang/matlab-codes-for-bachelor-thesis.git
   ```
2. **Open MATLAB** and add the repository folder to your MATLAB path.

3. **Run the scripts**:
   - Execute individual `.m` files for specific tasks.
   - Refer to comments in each script for usage instructions.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or newer is recommended.
- No additional toolboxes required for basic plotting and calculations.

## Repository Structure

- `polyhedron_plot.m`: Script for visualizing polyhedra.
- `calculate_properties.m`: Functions for property calculations.
- Other auxiliary scripts for supporting geometry operations.
